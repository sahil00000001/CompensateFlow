Project Overview
Build a complete web-based Increment Process Automation System for managing annual employee performance reviews, ratings, and salary increments across a hierarchical organization structure. The system must handle multi-level approvals, 360-degree feedback, self-assessments, one-on-one meetings, appeals, and maintain strict data privacy boundaries between hierarchy levels.
